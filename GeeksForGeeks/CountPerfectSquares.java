// Given a positive integer n, find the number of perfect squares that are less than n in the sample space
// of perfect squares. The sample space consists of all perfect squares starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, â€¦)
// Input: n = 9;    Output: 2   1 and 4 are only perfect squares less than 9
